The following is my research on AGI

1. [Wikipedia: Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) good for defining AGI
2. [BEYOND REWARD AND PUNISHMENT by David Deutsch](https://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PossibleMinds_Deutsch.pdf) this document discusses the need for AGI to be given it's freedom
3. [AI that’s smarter than humans? Americans say a firm “no thank you.”](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll)
